Linear Regression Model for Determining Factors  that are Correlated with Depression in College Students 


Research Question: 

To what extent do the variables, gender, age, profession, academic pressure, work pressure, study satisfaction, job satisfaction, sleep duration, dietary habits, degree, work/study hours, financial stress, and familial history affect depression among college students?


Hypothesis: 

Null Hypothesis: The variables gender, age, profession, academic pressure, work pressure, study satisfaction, job satisfaction, sleep duration, dietary habits, degree, work/study hours, financial stress, and familial history are not statistically significant to depression among college students.  

Alternate Hypothesis: The variables gender, age, profession, academic pressure, work pressure, study satisfaction, job satisfaction, sleep duration, dietary habits, degree, work/study hours, financial stress, and familial history are statistically significant to depression among college students.


Summary of Research Question:  

I have been to many universities within the last ten years, and at almost every university, there has been at least one suicide attempt. Unfortunately, many of those attempts resulted in fatality. The fatalities caused the universities to send a mass email offering counseling to students, but after a week, the suicide attempts were never talked about again. I was curious as to why this happens at universities. 
According to Abbot (2021), nearly 42% of students felt depressed to the point where they were unable to function. Additionally, a student’s support system may have difficulty recognizing symptoms of depression and understanding the “Why?” As a college student, I have been diagnosed with depression, and things have gotten worse related to schooling, but also other outside factors. I chose to research what variables affect depression among college students because of the suicide experiences on campus and my own depression diagnosis. I was curious as to what other factors can affect students' feelings of depression. 


Analysis: 

For the data analysis, I will be using multiple linear regressions. Multiple linear regressions are based on assumptions. One assumption is that there’s a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Another assumption is that the independent variables are not directly correlated with one another. Additionally, there’s an assumption that observations are chosen randomly and that residuals are normally distributed.


Summary of Data Analysis: 

The analysis revealed that academic pressure, study satisfaction, work/study hours, financial stress, family history of mental illness, age, degree type, dietary habits, and sleep duration were significant predictors of students who reported experiencing depression. The regression model explained a meaningful portion of the variance in depression outcomes, suggesting that these variables are strongly associated with student mental health. The Q-Q plot indicates that the normality assumption was satisfied; however, the residual scatterplot displayed a structured pattern, violating linearity and homoscedasticity. This discrepancy implies that the model satisfies the normality assumption but may be missing key interactions or non-linear relationships (Bobbitt, 2023). These findings suggest that both lifestyle and demographic factors contribute meaningfully to mental health outcomes.
